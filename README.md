Update: trying to figure out how to commit my changes to the starting project. It's proving a bit tricky... :/

Third app from my (re)Boot Camp (2023 reboot of the iOS App Development Udemy course by the London App Brewery).

On this reboot of my iOS Dev journey, I'm going to use GitHub to show my work and to summarize my learning through each unit/project.

Because the starting project for this app (and probably all subsequent apps) was cloned from an existing file, the original commits will be from the project originators (London App Brewery/Angela Yu). 

All work completed in 2023 is my own. (I'm going to try something different with this one... my goal is to add functionality to the original project by including a scoring system and a reset button. I'll be expanding my knowledge/experience with GitHub/source control by managing my changes here. (Wish me luck! :)

Acquired Skills (as per the originator's description):
* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.

** NOTE: the shortcut for image literals in Xcode has changed since the course was created. See the "Code Graveyard" section in the ViewController.swift file for explanation.

# Dicee

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps you’ll build in the future. This app will teach you a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.

## What you will create

We’re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, you’ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!
